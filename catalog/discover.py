"""Find native PS5 apps on public GitHub that the catalog doesn't list yet.

Runs daily in CI (.github/workflows/discovery.yml). Every candidate that passes
all automated checks becomes a listing pull request (one per app, branch
listing/<TITLEID>) that a maintainer reviews with
docs/maintainers/listing-runbook.md and merges by hand; the job never merges or
pushes to main. Candidates that need a person first are summarised in one
tracking issue that the job rewrites. It only reads other repositories: no
downloads, no contact with developers.

A repository becomes a candidate through a search hit or because its owner
already has a listed or strongly signalled app. It is then checked cheapest
first: already listed or ignored, then a published release with a .zip, .ffpkg
or .ffpfsc file, then the full `draft` checks (param.json, title ID, digest,
icon, license). The judgment fields `draft` leaves open are filled with
labelled guesses (kind from keywords, description from the repository's About
text or README) for the reviewer to confirm.
